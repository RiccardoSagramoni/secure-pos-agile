# SecurePOS

University project for *Software System Engineering* course (MSc Computer Engineering at University of Pisa, A.Y. 2022-23)

Development of a pipelined application (a **secure POS monitoring system**), based on *DataOps* approach, to support productivity metrics.

The main focus of the project was to master the **AGILE methodology** (Trello, Clockify) and the **Unified Process** during all the project phases: requirements (workflow landscape, BPMN diagrams), analysis (detailed use cases, sequence diagrams, class diagrams), design (class diagram), development (Python code) and testing.
